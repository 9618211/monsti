Monsti CMS
==========

Monsti is a simple and resource efficient CMS for low dynamic private and small
business sites with mostly static pages and simple structure.

Its written in Go, a statically typed compiled language that feels almost like a
dynamic language.

Monsti is still under heavy development and unstable. You should not use it for
critical tasks.

Have a look at Monsti's roadmap:

Design goals
------------

 - Simple design.
 - Low resource usage, especially memory usage. This goal is more important for
   multi site instances.
 - Simple access control: Objects are private or public, no groups, only
   authenticated users which may access private objects.
 - Simple architecture: use flat files instead of a DBMS.
 - Simple and intuitive web user interface.


Flat files
----------

Monsti doesn't use a DBMS but flat files. Sites are organized as trees where
each node corresponds to a subdirectory in the flat file directory tree. Each
node's subdirectory contains its data and meta-data. Every subdirectory consists
of a node.yaml YAML formatted file describing the node. A typical structure might
look like this ('/' is the root of the site's data directory):

/about
/about/body.html
/about/node.yaml
/body.html
/contact
/contact/body.html
/contact/node.yaml
/navigation.yaml
/node.yaml
