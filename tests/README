This directory contains Selenium tests for Monsti CMS.

You need a recent Chrome/Chromium and ChromeDriver[1]. Other browsers should
work too, but the Firefox driver has problems with filling out the Aloha editor
fields.

To run the tests, you first have to start the Monsti example instance and
ChromeDriver. After that, run "go test" in this directory.

The tests will change the example/ data files. Keep that in mind until Monsti
gets a more sophisticated Selenium test setup ;)
