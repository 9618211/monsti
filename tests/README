This directory contains Selenium tests for Monsti.

You need a recent Chrome/Chromium and ChromeDriver[1]. Other browsers should
work too, but are not officially supported at the moment.

To run the tests, you first have to start the Monsti example instance
(go to the example directory and run start.sh) and ChromeDriver
(listening on the default port 9515)[2]. After that, run "make
test-browser" in the package's root.

The tests will change some of the example/ data files. Keep that in
mind when commiting any changes until Monsti gets a more sophisticated
Selenium test setup ;)
